# ChickenDetection
Create a custom machine learning model to recognize our six chickens by name
![Two Chickens](https://github.com/DennisFaucher/ChickenDetection/blob/master/Images/Jaja%20Kielyr.png)
## Why
Two Reasons:
1) At work, I am helping multiple customers build machine learning solutions to advance drug discovery and overall subscriber health. Understanding machine learning for object detection at a deeper level will enable me to better guide my customers.
2) I love our chickens
## How
### Parts List
* ChickensüôÇüêì: We ordered our chickens as chicks [here](https://www.mypetchicken.com/catalog/Baby-Chicks-c36.aspx)
* Access to an NVIDIA GPU with enough video RAM for training: My laptop does not have an NVIDIA GPU, my NVIDIA Xavier GPU core dumps if you try to train a new model on it.  I rented an AWS g2.2xlarge GPU instance with the Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04) Version 29.0 AMI.
* RTSP-Capable camera: I use this one(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GSS4ZHK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
